# 5.2 Data Acquisition 
*This project was developed with the purpose of beginning a research cycle into predictive policing for Baltimore. To do so, the team created an ideal situation under which data acquisition would be of a higher level so that future developments can build on our project towards this potential goal.*

###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
The ideal situation is based on the orginal design of the opportunity presented by our team, under the logical hypothesis. This is also the overseeing goal of this project, to provide a basis to work towards this logical hypothesis long-term. 

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
The practical situation is the situation under which this project was built, according to constraints such as time and resource availability. It follows the redesign of the hypothesis into an empirical hypothesis. 

##### _List the data you need and how much you need_ 
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__

> - Complete data data on crimes in Baltimore, inclduing information on arrests and calls that were made where no crime was committed.
>- Current and up to date dataset on local crime sprees by description (arsonry, sexual assault, robberies, homicide, etc.)
>- Criminal records data on known criminals and areas of their last crimes by type of crime. 
>- Would require at least complete datasets on the last three years for all three types of data described above. 

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- Open source dataset from Kaggle containing limited varIables, and data, on crimes in Baltimore. 
>- Information on the two years worth of crime in Baltimore.

##### _Find and document where you can get that data_ 
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- FBI dataset would contain the advanced type of data that would be required on crimes in Baltimore, current crime sprees, criminal records and even potentially expected movement of crime from other cities & states.
>- If a release of this FBI dataset would not be avaialble thne the local police force databases in Baltimore would be able to provide local information on crime in Baltimore, limited information on expected & known crime sprees in Baltimore and known re-offending criminals. 
>- The police force databases in Baltimore can be supplemented with prison (dependent on scope of the analysis) datasets to have complete access on criminal records and status. 
 
###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- Kaggle contained an open source limited dataset on crime in Baltimore. 
 
##### _Check how much space it will take_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Expected that storage will require additional considerations due to privacy issues and how big the datasets are. Therefore, would expect potentially utilizing object storage in the form OF external hard drives. 

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- Open source and small dataset, so easily downloadable, therefore requires limited storage. 

##### _Check legal obligations and get authorization if necessary_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Requires heavy legal obligations and high clearance due to the fact that this data contains private information and information belonging to the government and government entities. 
>- Authorization to attain and use this dataset is necessary

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- There are no legal obligations or authorization required since the information is open source and it contains no sensitive information. 

##### _Get access authorizations_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Authorization to attain and use this dataset is necessary.
>- The authorization would be coming from the owners of the dataset (ie, FBI, Baltimore police force, prisons, etc.)

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- No authorization is required, open source dataset from Kaggle.

##### _Create a workspace(with enough storage space)_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Workspace created would have to meet the expectations of those providing datasets due to privacy concerns. 

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- The use of laptops was appropriate for the work being conducted for the purpose of this proejct. 

##### _Get the data_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- *Would have to reach out to the required parties above*

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- The data was downloaded from Kaggle. The link to it is included in the project description. 

##### _Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself)_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Would have to determine if the datasets should be compacted into cSV files or determine another means for analysis. 

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- Data was already in a format that could be easily manipulated, csv. 


##### _Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g. anonymized)_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Would determine standards to do this according to the contraints presented by all active parties.

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- There was no sensitive information included in the data. 

##### _Check the size and type of the data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.)_
---
###### __IDEAL SITUATION__
>- Determined once the data is retrieved. Should be somewhat similar to the *PRACTICAL SITUATION* data type below. 

###### __PRACTICAL SITUATION__
>- It is 39.27 MB in size and the data can be considered time series and geogrpahical, as the crime is divided by area and is occurring with the passing of time.
