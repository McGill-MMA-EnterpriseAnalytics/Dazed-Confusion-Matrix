# Threats to Validity
*Like most projects, our work faces threats to validity in the form of sampling bias, history, and maturation*

#### __1. SAMPLING BIAS__
> The dataset being used is not as representative of the population as we would have ideally wanted. It does not include information like active times of no crime, sprees of crime (arsonry, robberies, assaults, etc) and so on.  

#### __2. HISTORY__

> Currently, we cannot be certain if there exists unrelated events that heavily influenced crime, like local economic crashes or social changes outside of the norm. 

#### __3. MATURATION__

> And finally maturation is a concern, as crime rates can improve/decline over time dependent on multiple exterior factors.

#### _Counteracting These Threats_

> Identify any external events or changes that may impact their results
> Add a comparable control group (dataset from a similar city)  
> Increase the sample size, because results would be more sensitive to any variability in the outcomes
