# HYPOTHESES
The original hypothesis for this project is the logical hypothesis, by which this team wanted to provide a tool for predictive policing in Baltimore. However, due to the constraints of this project, such as time and availability of resources, the scope of this project was mitigated into the empirical hypoethsis. Both hypothesis are included below, so that others can view this project, and hopefully continue the research cycle to achieve a good predictive tool for the police force. 
___

#### __LOGICAL HYPOTHESIS:__
An accurate predictive tool will improve the Baltimore police force’s KPI’s. 

#### __EMPIRICAL HYPOTHESIS:__
LightGBM provides the best balance of precision and recall for predicting the type of crime to occur next in Baltimore.
